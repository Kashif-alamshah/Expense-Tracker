# Expense-Tracker
A Python-based program called the Expense Tracker was created to assist users in efficiently managing their spending. It enables consumers to track, examine, and evaluate their spending over time. Modularity and code reuse are guaranteed by this application's adherence to object-oriented design principles. For simplicity, a console-based interface is used in its implementation.
# Features Implemented
Add Expense: Users can record an expense by specifying the category, amount, date, and an optional description.
View All Expenses: Displays a list of all recorded expenses, including details such as category, amount, date, and description.
View Expenses by Category: Allows users to filter and view expenses belonging to a specific category.
Calculate Total Expenses: Computes the total amount spent within an optional date range.
Exit: Safely exits the application.
